| MEGA65 model   |   Years   | File name             | Comment
|:--------------:|:---------:|:---------------------:|-------------------------
| R2             | 2019-2020 | &lt;none&gt;          | R2 is a very rare pre-series model, only 20 of them were built. The C64 for MEGA65 core does not run on R2 machines.
| R3/R3A         | 2020-2023 | C64MEGA65-V5.1-R3.cor | R3 is the "DevKit" (100 were built) and R3A are batches 1 and 2. If your MEGA65 was manufactured before 2024 then you have an R3 or R3A machine.
| R4             | 2023      | C64MEGA65-V5.1-R4.cor | Development board on our way to the R6. Only 10 of them were manufactured (board only, no complete machines).
| R5             | 2023      | C64MEGA65-V5.1-R5.cor | Upgraded version of R4 that contains new circuits for the expansion port. Only 10 of them were manufactured (board only, no complete machines).
| R6             | 2024+     | C64MEGA65-V5.1-R6.cor | Latest and greatest MEGA65. Manufactured from 2024 on.

| 1      | Bug: HDMI backpower issues                                 | [Learn more](../FAQ.md#2-my-mega65-or-the-c64-core-is-behaving-somehow-weirdly), what wide range of problems and strange effects HDMI backpower issues are creating and how to avoid these issues.                                                                     | yes      | no     | no   | no   |
| 2      | DAC for analog 3.5mm audio jack                            | While on R3/R3A machines the analog audio that comes out from the 3.5mm audio jack is "OK" and sometimes is plagued by hissing and humming, the newer machines feature a high-quality audio digital to analog converter (DAC) that leads to a crystal clear output.    | standard | DAC    | DAC  | DAC  |
| 3      | Hardware cartridges: Bi-directional reset signal           | Makes the core compatible with even more cartridges. Two examples that stand out are: (1) You do not need the "reset workaround" for the Kung Fu Flash (KFF) any more (2) Reset buttons and "special" buttons at most freezer cartridges are working now.              | no       | no     | yes  | yes  |
| 4      | Supercapacitor for Real-Time-Clock (RTC)                   | Ensures that the MEGA65 remembers the date/time even if you did not install a CR2032 battery.                                                                                                                                                                          | no       | yes    | yes  | yes  |
| 5      | Bug: Limited ability to pull Expansion Port's RESET to GND | R5 boards contain a bug that reduces compatibility as described here: https://github.com/MJoergen/C64MEGA65/issues/118. Can be fixed by "modding" the board. Needs some soldering skills.                                                                              | no       | no     | yes  | no   |
